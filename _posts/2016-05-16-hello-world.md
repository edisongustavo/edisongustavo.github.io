# First post!

Ok, so I'm pretty new in this "blog business" however I like writing.

I will try to post technical stuff here. Maybe I'll post non-technical stuff too, however, expect those posts to be rarer.

## Education

I'm a computer scientist who graduated at [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://ufsc.br/) in Computer Science.

## Work

I currently work at [ESSS](http://www.esss.com.br/) as a *Scientific Software Developer*.

My routine is dealing with technologies such as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and lately [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/).

## Interests

- Programming languages: Currently *Python* and *C++*
- **H**igh **P**erformance **C**omputing: GPGPU, Floating points
- Cloud computing: AWS, Heroku
