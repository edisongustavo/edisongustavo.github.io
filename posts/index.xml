      <description>Hello all,
My name is Edison Gustavo Muenz and I&#39;m a Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· that currently lives in Berlin.
My career path is:
 Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· (left in Feb/2017) South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ (from March/2017 to Dec/2018) Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (from Jan/2019)  I want to talk about Software and more recently Machine Learning and NLP. Maybe something about local culture too.
I&#39;m very interested in NLP lately because I&#39;ve joined a team at Amazon that works on NLP and I&#39;m finding it super exciting!</description>

      <description>My intention here is to show that it is indeed possible to use Jupyter to write blog posts, which I actually intend to do more often than writing Markdown
Why? Jupyter is great because I can mix code and documentation together.
print(&amp;#34;Text is supported :)&amp;#34;) Text is supported :)  For example, look at this example from the seaborn library:
!pip install seaborn import seaborn as sns sns.set() tips = sns.</description>
